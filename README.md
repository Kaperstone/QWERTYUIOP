# QWERTYUIOP
A set of (sometimes) silly macros that make certain YSI coding jobs even easier. Every macro is just one letter that corresponds as near as possible to its function. Although this did start off as a joke (because coding using very short identifiers isn't a good idea in the long run due to the obfuscation involved), several macros (especially D) have turned out to be very useful.
